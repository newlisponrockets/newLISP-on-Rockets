# Customizing your Rockets Blog

To customize your Rockets blog, you must log in as the Admin user. See [Running your Rockets blog](running_rockets_blog) for details.

## Go to the Admin page

Once you have signed in as the Admin user, click your user name at the upper right of the top menu, then click "Admin page" from the dropdown menu.

The Admin page contains five sub-pages, identified by blue buttons/tabs on the top of the page. These include:

* General Configuration
* Custom Configuration
* Media Configuration
* User Configuration
* Podcast Configuration

## General Configuration

Here you can set custom images for your blog header and forum header, change the name of your blog, customize the top menu, and configure page layouts.

### Changing blog and header images

To change blog and header forum images, click "Choose File", select a file from your computer and click OK, then click "Upload".

**WARNING: There is no file size limit in this dialog box. Try to choose image files 800 x 600 pixels or smaller.**

### Customizing the menu

To customize the top menu, enter in the menu name and target page name in the box. You can also delete menu items individually, or add new blank ones.

**NOTE: The page name doesn't have to include the ".lsp" extension, unless it is a numbered page, such as "rockets-item.lsp?p=127"**
