## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Rockets is a fast, fun, and customizable blog application that is open source. It's also an easy-to-learn web application development framework.

It runs on the Linux platform.

## Why Rockets? <a name="section1"></a>

You may be interested in running Rockets if you:

* Want to experiment with an easy-to-learn web application framework
* Are interested in LISP and LISP-like languages
* Feel like trying something different

If you are looking for a full-featured blog application with tons of available themes and plugins, you probably want something like 
[WordPress](wordpress.org) instead.

## Installing Rockets <a name="section2"></a>

To install Rockets, you will need a Linux operating system. This can be either:

1. A version of Linux installed on your home computer as the main operating system
2. A version of Linux running on a virtual machine (such as VirtualBox)
3. A version of Linux installed on a cloud service provider, such as Amazon AWS or Linode

If you are just experimenting at home, the first two options are fine. If you want to run Rockets as a public website,
choose the third option. Most home Internet service providers don't allow you to run public websites from your home computer.

For step-by-step instructions, click one of the links below:

* [Installation guide for Rockets on Ubuntu 20.04](install_rockets_ubuntu.md) (recommended for experimentation)
* Installation guide using the Linode cloud provider (recommended for public websites)
