# Running your Rockets Blog

## Sign in as the Admin user

When you installed Rockets, you will have created a single Admin user, which is a user that has complete control over the blog.

Specifically, an Admin user can:

* Post new blog posts
* Customize the appearance of the blog
* Delete blog and forum posts
* Delete other users

Enter your Admin email (your email is your user name) and password on the upper-right text boxes of the blog, then click Sign In, or press Enter.

## Make a new blog post

At the top of your site you will see a link called "Jump to post box". Click this link, and the page will jump down to the bottom.

Here is where you enter a new blog post. You can choose the type of post on the first dropdown menu:

* Blog post - a standard blog post, will appear on the front page of your blog
* Page - used for standalone pages that will not appear on the front page, but must be linked to directly
* Podcast - used to create a post where you can upload a podcast episode **NOTE: THIS FEATURE IS EXPERIMENTAL AND MAY NOT WORK**
* Forum notice - used to create a "sticky post" that will appear at the top of your forum

Then enter your post title, a list of searchable tags (use single words separated by commas), and the main content.

Optionally, you can add a poll title and poll options that will allow registered users to vote on a topic.

## Delete a blog post

The red button underneath a blog post will delete that post. **WARNING: There is no confirmation prompt at present. This will be added in version 2.1.**

## Add a new user

Log out from your Admin account, and click the green Register button to create a new user. Select the **three** pictures of rockets from the list. Enter your email address and password, and click Register.

You should be automatically signed in as the new user, but if not, sign in with the email and password combo you chose in the upper right.

## Add a forum post

Click the "Forum" link on the top menu bar, and scroll down to the New Post section.  Enter in a Post Title and Body of the message, then click the Post Message button.

## Delete a user

Log into your Admin account, and click your name in the upper-right part of the top menu.

From the dropdown menu that appears, click "Admin page".

Click the "User Configuration" tab.

Find your new user and click the "Delete" link.  **WARNING: There is no confirmation prompt at present. This will be added in version 2.1.**

## Experiment and play around

Enjoy your new Rockets blog! Have fun with it!

If you ever forget your Admin password, you can recover it with the "Forgot password?" link that appears when you enter an invalid password.
