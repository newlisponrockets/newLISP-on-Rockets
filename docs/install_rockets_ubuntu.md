# Step 1

First, you need an installation of Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. You can download an .ISO (a file that simulates a DVD-ROM install disc) here:

https://ubuntu.com/download/server

* Click on "Option 2 - Manual Server Installation"
* Click on the big green "Download Ubuntu Server 20.04.2 LTS" button

Save the .ISO file somewhere on your computer, such as your "Downloads" directory.
