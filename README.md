Source code for both the newLISP on Rockets framework and an example application, a blog that runs on Rockets.

Please check the [Rockets blog](https://newlisponrockets.com) for updates on the status of the project.

What is newLISP-on-Rockets?
---------------------------

Rockets started as a very simple web application framework running on newLISP.  My goal was to simplify the web applications I was already writing in newLISP by consolidating a bunch of useful functions for both front-end (jQuery) and back-end (SQLite) operations.  The emphasis was on simplicity and code conciseness.

Over time, I've adapted Rockets for use as my own personal blog, as well as other web projects I'm working on. This meant that the development framework and the blog have merged into a simple yet easily extensible blog application.
